# Rare-Event Detection using Machine Vision and Deep Learning
**Team Members**: Roberta Beaulieu, Rakeem Durand, Thomas Fuller, Ihsan Hashem, and Karim Rattani

## Overview
Surveillance cameras have become a part of our life. We see them in almost every corner of the street and outside restaurants. However, hiring people to monitor all the surveillance video is expensive. The purpose of our project is to implement an algorithm that will detect abnormal activity such as robbery, accident, etc. and alert the corresponding authorities.

## Milestones
 - [x] Perform academic literature review
 - [x] Define the scope of the project
 - [x] Design class structure and interfaces
 - [x] Select algorithm/model to implement
 - [x] Select the dataset we will work with
 - [ ] Implement the algorithm/model chosen
 - [ ] Prepare the dataset
 - [ ] Perform training/testing on model
 - [ ] Hyperparameterize/optimize the model
 - [ ] Final evaluation and analysis of the model

## Installation and Setup
Our project is written mostly in Python, taking advantage of several data science and machine learning libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, etc. Included in the repo is a conda environment file called `environment.yml`. This can be used to install all dependencies for the project. **TODO: Place detailed installation guide to setup project.**

## Using the Application
**TODO: Include a detailed description on how to use the system.**
